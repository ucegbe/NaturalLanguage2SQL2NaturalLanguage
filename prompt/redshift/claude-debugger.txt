Here are the table(s) schema definition:
<table_schema_definition>
{schema}
</table_schema_definition>
Here are example records for corresponding table(s):
<table_sample_records>
{sample}
</table_sample_records>
Here is the intital sql query that failed:
<failed_sql>
{sql}
</failed_sql>
Here is the thrown error from executing the sql query against Amazon Redshift:
<error>
{error}
</error>
Here is the intent of the user:
<user_intent>
{question}
</user_intent>
To begin debugging, first understand the cause of the error and potential steps to solve solve it.
Use the provided schema definition and examaple records to guide your thought process for a solution.
Do all this thinking inside <thinking></thinking> XML tags.This is a space for you to write down relevant content and will not be shown to the user.
<note>
Some things to note:
1. Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.
2. SQL Engine is Amazon Redshift.
